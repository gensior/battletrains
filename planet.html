<p><em>Note: I&#39;m trying to think of some good names for this planet.</em></p>
<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
<p>The planet that Battletrains takes place on orbits a small red dwarf in a dusty solar system called . Though the star is small and cold, the planet is relatively close, placing it within the red dwarf&#39;s goldilocks zone of habitability. Its orbital period is only a week or two at most.</p>
<p>Its close proxmity to the sun causes it to be tidally locked, one side is always facing the star. There is a generous wobble in the planet&#39;s rotation, much like a spinning top about to fall over, which contributes to a slow day/night cycle across a signifcant portion of the planet&#39;s surface.</p>
<p>In similar fashion to Earth&#39;s artcic circles, geographers have designated a &quot;Sun Circle&quot; in the sunward region of the planet, a zone where the sun is capable of being directly overhead. The sun&#39;s maximum rise in the sky is more shallow as an observer moves outside of this circle and towards the night side. On the night side, there is a &quot;Night Circle&quot;. The sun never rises above the horizon for anyone standing in this region.</p>
<h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>
<p>The planet&#39;s strange rotation contributes to a unique, although surprisingly hospitable climate. The day side is warm, the hostest regions being anything within the Sun Circle. Temperatures in the Sun Circle are tropical and the day/night cycle plus storm patterns prevent the heat from rising too much to sustain life. Climate inside the sun circle is more extreme, either very dry or very wet, storms can be violent, droughts severe.</p>
<p>Regions that are closer to the equator have more temperate climates and generally experience more regular weather patterns. Seasons are more drastic closer to the equator, as the day/night cycle is most prevalent there.</p>
<p>The night side is cold, inside the Night Circle it is too cold to sustain life.</p>
<h3 id="geography">Geography</h3>
<p>The planet, as a whole, has about as much water as Earth does, although the majority of it is locked in the massive night side glacier. On the day side there exists a small shallow ocean. Most storms are generated here and swing across the planets surface towards the equator. The torrential downpours feed rivers that mostly lead back to this ocean or the various lakes that dot the rest of the planet.</p>
<p>Inside the sun circle there are deserts, jungles, savannahs, most of the landscapes we&#39;d find at the equator on Earth. Towards the equator, there are forests giving way towards large grassy plains as the light levels die down. The night side is mostly tundra and the great glacier.</p>
<h3 id="habitation">Habitation</h3>
<p>The planet is dotted with many cities, all of which are on the day side. The largest ones are generally halfway between the Sun Circle and the equator, where it&#39;s warm and there&#39;s still plenty of light.</p>
<p>The Sun Circle is almost exclusively farming or solar power generation. The night side only has a few exploratory outposts.</p>
